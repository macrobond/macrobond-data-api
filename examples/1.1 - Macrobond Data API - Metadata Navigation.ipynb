    "*Understanding Macrobond's metadata attributes*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to act as a template and guidline in which certain elements can be minipulated to get the desired outcome. Here we demonstrate how the Metadata methods work in the Macrobond Data API for Python when you want to get more information for a particular time series and understand the various attributes you can use to refine your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental database concepts\n",
    "The database stores _entities_. Entities can be things like TimeSeries, Region, Source, Release and Category.\n",
    "All entities have a _unique name_ and a set of _metadata_.\n",
    "Some types of entities have _additional_ data. The most important example of this is the TimeSeries entity that, in addition to name and metadata, also has a list of values and a list of corresponding dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just interested in the metadata of an entity, you can use methods such as `get_one_entity`. If you are interested in both metadata and time series values, you probably want to use methods like `get_one_series` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entity has one or more unique names. Some entities may have more than one name; all entities have a _primary name_ that can never change, but some have additional _aliases_. For instance the TimeSeries with the primary name `usnaac0169` also has the alias `usgdp`. You can use either name to reference this entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the focus of this notebook is on understanding the metadata, we will look at time series from an entity perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata of an entity is a set of attributes. Each attribute has a name and a value. For instance, the there is an attribute called `Frequency` that can contain values like `daily` and `monthly`. This attribute is present on TimeSeries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other metadata attributes may tell what region a time series relates to, the source where the observation comes from, the category under which the time series is classified, or the methodology used by the source to create the observation. These are just some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The examples use the common functions of Macrobond API. Full error handling is omitted for brevity*"
